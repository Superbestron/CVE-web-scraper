# Project Title
Python Web Scraper for cvedetails.com

# Motivation
I wanted to have a database of CVE vulnerabilities ready at my disposal, so exporting the entire database of vulnerabilities from a CVE online database to a document would be helpful. This project took me around 5 days to complete it (although bugs could still be present despite my attempts at squashing all of them).

# Tech/framework used
Python3, with requests, BeautifulSoup from bs4, and pandas as pd installed

# Features
Allows a user to search for CVE vulnerabilities on http://cvedetails.com based on vulnerability type, product name and vendor name (more search functions could be potentially added in). All available details of the vulnerabilities scraped from the website will be exported to a CSV file named CVE_DATABASE.csv.
1. User can specify which vulnerability details are to be omitted during its export to the csv file
2. For each search function (product name, vendor name etc.), user has the choice of inputting a keyword or omit it entirely

# How to use
1. For product and vendor name search, it is possible to leave it blank
2. For vulnerability type search, only type in one number at a time, entering in a different format will cause the program to crash
3. To choose which data to be omitted in the csv file, type in all numbers (that correspond to each category) at one go, leaving a space in between each number e.g. 5 12 (if indexes 5 and 12 are to be omitted), entering in a different format will cause the program to crash

# Speed
Time taken to dump the whole database of vulnerabilities (115750 as of 23/5/2019) is 75 min, which is the upper time limit of the program.

# Contribute
Feel free to give suggestions on room for improvement! I know the code can seem inelegant because of the way I used hard-coded stuff in many places, but still do let me know if there is another way to circumvent this issue!\
